# I2C-protocol-Atmega-328P
Communicate between Master and Slave microcontroller using I2C protocol. Microchip IDE is used to write the code for Atmega328P microcontroller.
Slave address is initialized as 0x10, SCL and SDA signal are observed in the logic analyzer.
Master C program code is attached in the file.![i2c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78633686/232284080-2e89b235-7ae6-4819-a461-b278603093ac.jpg)
